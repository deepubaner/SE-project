# Healthcare Dashboard System

A comprehensive dashboard system for healthcare applications with role-based access control for Users (Patients), Doctors, and Administrators.

## 🏗️ Architecture

The dashboard system consists of a main Dashboard component that routes to different dashboard types based on user roles:

```
Dashboard/

├── UserDashboard.jsx (Patient dashboard)
├── UserDashboard.css (Patient dashboard styles)
├── DoctorDashboard.jsx (Healthcare provider dashboard)
├── DoctorDashboard.css (Doctor dashboard styles)
├── AdminDashboard.jsx (System administration dashboard)
├── AdminDashboard.css (Admin dashboard styles)
└── README.md (This file)
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Role Switching
The dashboard includes a role switcher for testing different user experiences:

```jsx
const handleRoleChange = (newRole) => {
  setUserRole(newRole); // 'user', 'doctor', or 'admin'
};
```

### User Data
Mock user data is included for demonstration. In production, this would come from your authentication system:

```jsx
const mockUser = {
  id: 1,
  name: 'John Doe',
  email: 'john.doe@example.com',
  role: 'user',
  avatar: null
};
```

### Notifications
The system includes a notification system that can be customized:

```jsx
const mockNotifications = [
  { id: 1, message: 'Your appointment is confirmed', type: 'info', read: false },
  { id: 2, message: 'New medical record uploaded', type: 'success', read: false }
];
```

## 📱 Responsive Breakpoints

- **Mobile**: < 640px
- **Tablet**: 640px - 1024px
- **Desktop**: > 1024px

## 🌙 Dark Mode Support

The dashboards automatically support dark mode based on system preferences:

```css
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  /* Dark mode styles */
}
```

## ♿ Accessibility Features

- **WCAG 2.1 AA compliance**
- **Keyboard navigation support**
- **Screen reader compatibility**
- **High contrast mode support**
- **Reduced motion preferences**
- **Focus management**

## 🚀 Performance Optimizations

- **Lazy loading**: Components load only when needed
- **Memoization**: React.memo for expensive components
- **Efficient re-renders**: Optimized state management
- **CSS optimization**: Minimal CSS with utility classes

## 🔒 Security Considerations

- **Role-based access control**
- **Input validation**
- **XSS protection**
- **CSRF protection** (when implementing backend)
- **Secure authentication** (to be implemented)

## 🧪 Testing

### Component Testing
Each dashboard component can be tested independently:

```jsx
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import UserDashboard from './UserDashboard';

test('renders user dashboard', () => {
  render(<UserDashboard user={{ name: 'John Doe' }} />);
  expect(screen.getByText('Patient Dashboard')).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

### Integration Testing
Test the complete dashboard flow:

```jsx
test('switches between dashboard types', () => {
  render(<Dashboard />);
  fireEvent.click(screen.getByText('Doctor'));
  expect(screen.getByText('Doctor Dashboard')).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

## 📈 Future Enhancements

### Planned Features

- **Advanced analytics**: Charts and data visualization
- **Mobile app**: React Native companion app
- **Offline support**: Service worker for offline functionality
- **Multi-language**: Internationalization support
- **Advanced search**: Full-text search with filters
- **File management**: Document upload and management
